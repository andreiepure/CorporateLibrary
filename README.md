Repository for https://www.meetup.com/dotnetiasi/events/287271942/

Beware of the [Evil_Hacker](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Corporate.Private.Library/1.0.9999)!

Feel free to use this repository to demo in your company or team on how Dependency Confusion works.

And please don't forget to mention me when doing so :).

Thanks.
